If you're reading this, I've offered to share my Plex libraries with you. I maintain a Plex server that conatins my movies, tv shows, music videos, and other libraries. By creating a free Plex account amd installing the Plex app (available on streaming devices and mobile devices for free), you'll be able to access my media free of charge, free of advertising, & and free of suggestions. 

### 1. Create a free Plex account [here](https://www.plex.tv/sign-up/) by providing an email address and setting a password. Be sure to check your email and confirm/verify your account creation.

### 2. Install the free Plex app (or channel) available on iOS app store, google play store, roku, amazon fire stick, ect. Once installed, sign in with the credentials you created on step 1.

### 3. Accesing my Plex Sevrver happens after I send you an invite to my Plex libraries. This invite will be sent to the emaill address you associated with your Plex account. Only AFTER you accept the invite can you access my Plex Server.
